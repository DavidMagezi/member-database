# member-database
A program to read spreadsheet data of society members and convert it to a database. The program is being built using test driven development. First requirements are sketched. Next a class diagram is created. Importantly, tests are created ***before*** a functioning class implementation is written. 

## Requirements

An administrator must be able to read the original spreadsheet, add, modify and delete member records, and export the member list, either as a spreadsheet, or as a list of emails.

## Class diagram
